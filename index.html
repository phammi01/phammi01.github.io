        <p class="question">Proportionally, based on the ratio between the body's weight and the maximum weight capable of lifting, what is the strongest animal on this planet?</p>
        <p class="answer">It's the Onthophagus taurus (dung beetle). The strongest males of this species can pull 1,140 times of their own body weight. To put that into perspective that would be like one of us lifting a 76.5 ton armoured tank</p>
